== Annotations

This chapter describes the annotations used by JAX-WS.

For simplicity, when describing an annotation we use the term
``property'' in lieu of the more correct ``annotation elements''. Also,
for each property we list the default value, which is the default as it
appears in the declaration of the annotation type. Often properties have
logical defaults which are computed based on contextual information and,
for this reason, cannot be captured using the annotation element default
facility built into the language. In this case, the text describes what
the logical default is and how it is computed.

JAX-WS 2.0 uses annotations extensively. For an annotation to be
correct, besides being syntactically correct, e.g. placed on a program
element of the appropriate type, it must obey a set of constraints
detailed in this specification. For annotations defined by JSR-181, the
annotation in question must also obey the constraints in the relevant
specification (see <<bib16>>).

_♦ Conformance (Correctness of annotations):_ An implementation MUST check at runtime
that the annotations pertaining to a method being invoked, either on the
client or on the server, as well as any containing program elements
(i.e. classes, packages) is in conformance with the specification for
that annotation

_♦ Conformance (Handling incorrect annotations):_ If an incorrect or inconsistent
annotation is detected:

* In a client setting, an implementation MUST NOT invoke the remote
operation being invoked, if any. Instead, it MUST throw a
`WebServiceException`, setting its cause to an exception approximating
the cause of the error (e.g. an `IllegalArgumentException` or a
`ClassNotFoundException`).
* In a server setting, annotation, an implementation MUST NOT dispatch
to an endpoint implementation object. Rather, it MUST generate a fault
appropriate to the binding in use.

_♦ Conformance (Unsupported `WebServiceFeatureAnnotation`):_ If an unrecongnized or
unsupported annotation annotated with the `WebServiceFeatureAnnotation`
meta-annotation:

* In a client setting, an implementation MUST NOT invoke the remote
operation being invoked, if any. Instead, it MUST throw a
`WebServiceException`, setting its cause to an exception approximating
the cause of the error (e.g. an `IllegalArgumentException` or a
`ClassNotFoundException`).
* In a server setting, annotation, an implementation MUST NOT dispatch
to an endpoint implementation object. Rather, it MUST generate a fault
appropriate to the binding in use.

An implementation may check for correctness in a lazy way, at the time a
method is invoked or a request is about to be dispatched to an endpoint,
or more aggressively, e.g. when creating a proxy. In a container
environment, an implementation may perform any correctness checks at
deployment time.

[[mdservicemode]]
=== javax.xml.ws.ServiceMode

The `ServiceMode` annotation is used to specify the mode for a provider
class, i.e. whether a provider wants to have access to protocol message
payloads (e.g. a SOAP body) or the entire protocol messages (e.g. a SOAP
envelope).


[id="Table 7.1"]
Table 7.1: `ServiceMode` properties.
|==================================
|Property   |Description    |Default
|`value`      |The service mode, one of
javax.xml.ws.Service.Mode. MESSAGE or
javax.xml.ws.Service.Mode.PAYLOAD.
MESSAGE means that the whole protocol
message will be handed to the provider
instance, PAYLOAD that only the payload of
the protocol message will be handed to the
provider instance.
|javax.xml.ws.Service.Mode.PAYLOAD
|==================================

The `ServiceMode` annotation type is marked `@Inherited`, so the
annotation will be inherited from the superclass.

[[mdwebfault]]
=== javax.xml.ws.WebFault

The `WebFault` annotation is used when mapping WSDL faults to Java
exceptions, see section <<faulttoexceptmap>>. It is used to capture the
name of the fault element used when marshalling the JAXB type generated
from the global element referenced by the WSDL fault message. It can
also be used to customize the mapping of service specific exceptions to
WSDL faults.

[id="Table 7.2"]
Table 7.2: `WebFault` properties.
|==================================
|Property   |Description                        |Default
|`name`     |The local name of the element      |””
|`targetNamespace`  |The namespace name of the element  |””
|`faultBean`    |The fully qualified name of the fault bean class   |””
|`messageName`  |The name of the wsdl:message   |””
|==================================


[[mdrequestWrapper]]
=== javax.xml.ws.RequestWrapper

The `RequestWrapper` annotation is applied to the methods of an SEI. It
is used to capture the JAXB generated request wrapper bean and the
element name and namespace for marshalling / unmarshalling the bean. The
default value of `localName` element is the `operationName` as defined
in `WebMethod` annotation and the default value for the
`targetNamespace` element is the target namespace of the SEI. When
starting from Java, this annotation is used to resolve overloading
conflicts in document literal mode. Only the `className` element is
required in this case.

[id="Table 7.3"]
Table 7.3: `RequestWrapper` properties.
|==================================
|Property   |Description        |Default
|`localName`    |The local name of the element  |””
|`targetNamespace`  |The namespace name of the element  |””
|`className`    |The name of the wrapper class  |””
|`partName`     |The name of the wsdl:part  |””
|==================================

[[mdresponseWrapper]]
=== javax.xml.ws.ResponseWrapper

The `ResponseWrapper` annotation is applied to the methods of an SEI. It
is used to capture the JAXB generated response wrapper bean and the
element name and namespace for marshalling / unmarshalling the bean. The
default value of the `localName` element is the `operationName` as
defined in the `WebMethod` appended with ``Response'' and the default
value of the `targetNamespace` element is the target namespace of the
SEI. When starting from Java, this annotation is used to resolve
overloading conflicts in document literal mode. Only the `className`
element is required in this case.

[id="Table 7.4"]
Table 7.4: `ResponseWrapper` properties.
|==================================
|Property   |Description    |Default
|`localName`    |The local name of the element  |””
|`targetNamespace`  |The namespace name of the element  |””
|`className`    |The name of the wrapper class  |””
|`partName`     |The name of the wsdl:part  |””
|==================================


[[mdwebsvcclient]]
=== javax.xml.ws.WebServiceClient

The `WebServiceClient` annotation is specified on a generated service
class (see <<gensvcif>>). It is used to associate a class with a specific
Web service, identify by a URL to a WSDL document and the qualified name
of a `wsdl:service` element.

[id="Table 7.5"]
Table 7.5: `ResponseWrapper` properties.
|==================================
|Property   |Description    |Default
|`name`     |The local name of the service  |””
|`targetNamespace`  |The namespace name of the service  |””
|`wsdlLocation` |The URL for the WSDL description of the service |””
|==================================

When resolving the URI specified as the `wsdlLocation` element or any
document it may transitively reference, a JAX-WS implementation MUST use
the catalog facility defined in section <<catalogfacility>>.

[[mdwebendpoint]]
=== javax.xml.ws.WebEndpoint

The `WebEndpoint` annotation is specified on the `get`_PortName_`()`
methods of a generated service class (see <<gensvcif>>). It is used to
associate a get method with a specific `wsdl:port`, identified by its
local name (a `NCName`).

[id="Table 7.6"]
Table 7.6: `WebEndpoint` properties.
|==================================
|Property   |Description    |Default
|`name`     |The local name of the port  |””
|==================================

[[example-5]]
==== Example

The following shows a WSDL extract and the resulting generated service
class.

[source,java,numbered]
-------------
<!-- WSDL extract -->
<wsdl:service name="StockQuoteService">
    <wsdl:port name="StockQuoteHTTPPort" binding="StockQuoteHTTPBinding"/>
    <wsdl:port name="StockQuoteSMTPPort" binding="StockQuoteSMTPBinding"/>
</wsdl:service>

// Generated Service Class
@WebServiceClient(name="StockQuoteService",
                  targetNamespace="...",
                  wsdlLocation="...")
public class StockQuoteService extends javax.xml.ws.Service {
    public StockQuoteService() {
        super(wsdlLocation_fromAnnotation, serviceName_fromAnnotation);
    }

    public StockQuoteService(String wsdlLocation, QName serviceName) {
        super(wsdlLocation, serviceName);
    }

    // Other StockQuoteService constructors
    ...

    @WebEndpoint(name="StockQuoteHTTPPort")
    public StockQuoteProvider getStockQuoteHTTPPort() {
        return super.gePort(portName, StockQuoteProvider.class);
    }

    @WebEndpoint(name="StockQuoteHTTPPort")
    public StockQuoteProvider getStockQuoteHTTPPort(WebServiceFeature... f) {
        return super.gePort(portName, StockQuoteProvider.class, f);
    }

    @WebEndpoint(name="StockQuoteSMTPPort")
    public StockQuoteProvider getStockQuoteSMTPPort() {
        return super.getPort(portName, StockQuoteProvider.class);
    }

    @WebEndpoint(name="StockQuoteSMTPPort")
    public StockQuoteProvider getStockQuoteSMTPPort(WebServiceFeature... f) {
        return super.getPort(portName, StockQuoteProvider.class, f);
    }
}
-------------

[[mdwebsvcprovider]]
=== javax.xml.ws.WebServiceProvider

The `WebServiceProvider` annotation is specified on classes that
implement a strongly typed `javax.xml.ws.Provider`. It is used to
declare that a class that satisfies the requirements for a provider (see
<<providersvcapi>>) does indeed define a Web service endpoint, much like
the `WebService` annotation does for SEI-based endpoints.

The `WebServiceProvider` and `WebService` annotations are mutually
exclusive.

_♦ Conformance (WebServiceProvider and WebService):_ A class annotated with the
`WebServiceProvider` annotation MUST NOT carry a `WebService`
annotation.

[id="Table 7.7"]
Table 7.7: `WebServiceProvider` properties.
|==================================
|Property   |Description    |Default
|`wsdlLocation` |The URL for the WSDL description   |””
|`serviceName`  |The name of the service        |””
|`portName`     |The name of the port       |””
|`targetNamespace`  |The target namespace for the service   |””
|==================================

When resolving the URL specified as the `wsdlLocation` element or any
document it may transitively reference, a JAX-WS implementation MUST use
the catalog facility defined in section <<catalogfacility>>.

[[mdbindingtype]]
=== javax.xml.ws.BindingType

The `BindingType` annotation is applied to an endpoint implementation
class. It specifies the binding to use when publishing an endpoint of
this type.

[id="Table 7.8"]
Table 7.8: `BindingType` properties.
|==================================
|Property   |Description    |Default
|`value` |The binding ID (a URI)   |””
|==================================

The default binding for an endpoint is the SOAP 1.1/HTTP one (see
chapter <<soapbindchap>>).

[[mdwebsvcref]]
=== javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef

The `WebServiceRef` annotation is used to declare a reference to a Web
service. It follows the resource pattern exemplified by the
`javax.annotation.Resource` annotation in JSR-250 <<bib35>>.

The injected references of `WebServiceRef` annotation are not guaranteed
to be thread safe. If the references are accessed by multiple threads,
usual synchronization techinques can be used to support multiple
threads.

The `WebServiceRef` annotation is required to be honored when running on
the Java EE 5 platform, where it is subject to the common resource
injection rules described by the platform specification <<bib36>>.

The injected references of `WebServiceRef` annotation can be configured
with the corresponding features of annotations annotated with
`WebServiceFeatureAnnotation` annotations. For example, a SEI reference
can be configured with the MTOM web service feature using `@MTOM`.
Similarly, a generated service reference can be configured with web
service features using the corresponding `WebServiceFeatureAnnotation`
annotations. JAX-WS specification defines three standard features
AddressingFeature, MTOMFeature and RespectBindingFeature that can be
used while creating proxy instances. However, there are no standard
features that can be used while creating service instances in the
current specification. A JAX-WS implementation may define its own
features but they will be non-portable across all JAX-WS
implementations.

If a JAX-WS implementation encounters an unsupported or unrecognized
annotation annotated with the `WebServiceFeatureAnnotation` that is
specified with `@WebServiceRef`, an error MUST be given.


[id="Table 7.9"]
Table 7.9: `WebServiceRef` properties.
|==================================
|Property   |Description    |Default
|`name`     |The name identifying the Web service reference.    |””
|`wsdlLocation`     |A URL pointing to the location of the WSDL
document for the service being referred to.|””
|`type`     |The resource type as a Java class object   |`Object.class`
|`value`        |The service type as a Java class object    |`Service.class`
|`mappedName`       |A product specific name that this resource should be mapped to.    |””
|`lookup`       |A portable JNDI lookup name that resolves
to the target web service reference.   |””
|==================================


The name of the resource, as defined by the `name` element (or
defaulted) is a name that is local to the application component using
the resource.

The name can be absolute JNDI name(with a logical namespace) or relative
to the JNDI java:comp/env namespace.

Many application servers provide a way to map these local names to names
of resources known to the application server. This `mappedName` is often
a global JNDI name, but may be a name of any form. Application servers
are not required to support any particular form or type of mapped name,
nor the ability to use mapped names. A mapped name is product-dependent
and often installation-dependent. No use of a mapped name is portable.

A defined reference can be resolved using a portable JNDI name provided
by `lookup` element. In this case, it is an error if there are any
circular dependencies between entries of references. Similarly, it is an
error if looking up the specified JNDI name results in a resource whose
type is not compatible with the reference being created. Since this
``lookup'' functionality is just resolving to an already defined
reference, only `name` can be specified with `lookup` (doesn’t require
any other metadata like `wsdlLocation` etc.).

There are two uses to the `WebServiceRef` annotation:

1.  To define a reference whose type is a generated service class. In
this case, the `type` and `value` element will both refer to the
generated service class type. Moreover, if the reference type can be
inferred by the field/method declaration the annotation is applied to,
the `type` and `value` elements MAY have the default value
(`Object.class`, that is). If the type cannot be inferred, then at least
the `type` element MUST be present with a non-default value.
2.  To define a reference whose type is a SEI. In this case, the `type`
element MAY be present with its default value if the type of the
reference can be inferred from the annotated field/method declaration,
but the `value` element MUST always be present and refer to a generated
service class type (a subtype of `javax.xml.ws.Service`).

The `wsdlLocation` element, if present, overrides the WSDL location
information specified in the `WebService` annotation of the referenced
generated service class.

When resolving the URI specified as the `wsdlLocation` element or any
document it may transitively reference, a JAX-WS implementation MUST use
the catalog facility defined in section <<catalogfacility>>.

[[example-6]]
==== Example

The following shows both uses of the `WebServiceRef` annotation.

[source,java,numbered]
-------------
// Generated Service Class

@WebServiceClient(name="StockQuoteService",
                  targetNamespace="...",
                  wsdlLocation="...")
public class StockQuoteService extends javax.xml.ws.Service {
    ...

    @WebEndpoint(name="StockQuoteHTTPPort")
    StockQuoteProvider getStockQuoteHTTPPort() { ... };

    @WebEndpoint(name="StockQuoteHTTPPort")
    StockQuoteProvider getStockQuoteHTTPPort(WebServiceFeature ... f) { ... };

    @WebEndpoint(name="StockQuoteSMTPPort")
    StockQuoteProvider getStockQuoteSMTPPort() { ... };

    @WebEndpoint(name="StockQuoteSMTPPort")
    StockQuoteProvider getStockQuoteSMTPPort(WebServiceFeature ... f) { ... };
}

// Generated SEI

@WebService(name="StockQuoteProvider",
            targetNamespace="...")
public interface StockQuoteProvider {
    Double getStockQuote(String ticker);
}

// Sample client code

@Stateless
public class ClientComponent {

    // WebServiceRef using the generated service interface type
    @WebServiceRef
    public StockQuoteService stockQuoteService;

    // WebServiceRef using the SEI type
    // stockQuoteProvider proxy is configured with MTOM feature
    @MTOM
    @WebServiceRef(StockQuoteService.class)
    private StockQuoteProvider stockQuoteProvider;


    // other methods go here...
}
-------------

[[mdwebsvcrefs]]
=== javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRefs

The `WebServiceRefs` annotation is used to declare multiple references
to Web services on a single class. It is necessary to work around the
limition against specifying repeated annotations of the same type on any
given class, which prevents listing multiple `javax.ws.WebServiceRef`
annotations one after the other. This annotation follows the resource
pattern exemplified by the `javax.annotation.Resources` annotation in
JSR-250 <<bib35>>.

Since no name and type can be inferred in this case, each
`WebServiceRef` annotation inside a `WebServiceRefs` MUST contain `name`
and `type` elements with non-default values.

The `WebServiceRef` annotation is required to be honored when running on
the Java EE 5 platform, where it is subject to the common resource
injection rules described by the platform specification <<bib36>>.

[id="Table 7.10"]
Table 7.10: `WebServiceRefs` properties.
|==================================
|Property   |Description    |Default
|`value`        |An array of `WebServiceRef` annotations, each defining a web
service reference. |`{}`
|==================================

There is no way to associate web service features with the injected
instances of this annotation. If an instance needs to be configured with
the web service features, use @WebServiceRef to inject the resource
along with its features.

[[example-7]]
==== Example

The following shows how to use the `WebServiceRefs` annotation to
declare at the class level two web service references. The first one
uses the SEI type, while the second one uses a generated service class
type.

[source,java,numbered]
-------------
@WebServiceRefs({@WebServiceRef(name="accounting"
                                type=AccountingPortType.class,
                                value=AccountingService.class),
                 @WebServiceRef(name="payroll",
                                type=PayrollService.class)})
@Stateless
public MyComponent {

    // methods using the declared resources go here...
}
-------------

[[mdjsr181]]
=== Annotations Defined by JSR-181

In addition to the annotations defined in the preceding sections, JAX-WS
2.0 uses several annotations defined by JSR-181.

_♦ Conformance (JSR-181 conformance):_ A JAX-WS 2.0 implementation MUST be conformant to
the JAX-WS profile of JSR-181 1.1 <<bib16>>.

As a convenience to the reader, the following sections reproduce the
definition of the JSR-181 annotations applicable to JAX-WS.

[[mdwebservice]]
==== javax.jws.WebService

[source,java,numbered]
-------------
@Target({TYPE})
public @interface WebService {
    String name() default "";
    String targetNamespace() default "";
    String serviceName() default "";
    String wsdlLocation() default "";
    String endpointInterface() default "";
    String portName() default "";
};
-------------

Consistently with the URI resolution process in JAX-WS, when resolving
the URI specified as the `wsdlLocation` element or any document it may
transitively reference, a JAX-WS implementation MUST use the catalog
facility defined in section <<catalogfacility>>.

[[mdwebmethod]]
==== javax.jws.WebMethod

[source,java,numbered]

[[action]]
=== javax.xml.ws.Action

The `Action` annotation is applied to the methods of a SEI. It is used
to specify the `input`, `output`, `fault` WS-Addressing Action values
associated with the annotated method.

For such a method, the mapped operation in the generated WSDL’s
`wsam:Action` attribute on the WSDL `input`, `output` and `fault`
messages of the WSDL operation is based upon which attributes of the
Action annotation have been specified. The `wsam:Action` computation
algorithm is specified in section <<wsamComputation>>

[id="Table 7.11"]
Table 7.11: `FaultAction` properties.
|==================================
|Property   |Description    |Default
|`fault`        |Array of FaultAction for the
wsdl:fault s of the operation   |””
|`input`        |Action for the wsdl:input of the operation |””
|`output`       |Action for the wsdl:output of the operation    |””
|==================================


[[faultaction]]
=== javax.xml.ws.FaultAction

The `FaultAction` annotation is used within the `Action` annotation to
specify the WS-Addressing Action of a service specific exception as
defined by section <<j2w11except>>.

The `wsam:Action` attribute value in the fault message in the generated
WSDL operation mapped for an exception class is equal to the
corresponding `value` in the FaultAction. The `wsam:Action` computation
algorithm is specified in section <<wsamComputation>>

[id="Table 7.12"]
Table 7.12: `FaultAction` properties.
|==================================
|Property   |Description    |Default
|`value`        |Action for the `wsdl:fault` of the operation   |””
|`output`       |Name of the exception class    |no defaults required property
|==================================

[[webservfeatureannotation]]
=== javax.xml.ws.spi.WebServiceFeatureAnnotation

The `WebServiceFeatureAnnotation` is a meta-annotation used by a JAX-WS
implementation to identify other annotations as `WebServiceFeature`s.
JAX-WS provides the following annotations as `WebServiceFeatures`:
`javax.xml.ws.soap.Addressing`, `javax.xml.ws.soap.MTOM`, and
`javax.xml.ws.RespectBinding`. If a JAX-WS implementation encounters an
annotation annotated with the `WebServiceFeatureAnnotation` that it does
not support or recognize an ERROR MUST be given.

[id="Table 7.13"]
Table 7.13: `WebServiceFeatureAnnotation` properties.
|==================================
|Property   |Description    |Default
|`id`        |Unique identifier for the
`WebServiceFeature` represented by the
annotated annotation.   |No defaults required property
|`bean`       |The class name of a derived
`WebServiceFeature` class associated with
the annotated annotation.    |No defaults required property
|==================================

The following shows how the `Addressing` annotation uses the
`WebServiceFeatureAnnotation` meta-annotation.

[source,java,numbered]
-------------
@WebServiceFeatureAnnotation(id=AddressingFeature.ID,
                             bean=AddressingFeature.class)
public @interface Addressing {
    /**
     * Specifies if this feature is enabled or disabled.
     */
    boolean enabled() default true;

    /**
     * Property to determine whether WS-Addressing
     * headers MUST be present on incoming messages.
     */
    boolean required() default false;
}
-------------

[[addrannotation]]
==== javax.xml.ws.soap.Addressing

The `Addressing` annotation is applied to an endpoint implementation
class and to an injected web service proxy reference. It is used to
control the use of WS-Addressing<<bib26>><<37>><<bib27>>.
It corresponds with the `AddressingFeature` described in section <<addressingfeature>>.

[id="Table 7.14"]
Table 7.14: `Addressing` properties.
|==================================
|Property   |Description    |Default
|`enabled`  |Specifies if WS-Addressing is enabled or not.  |true
|`required` |Specifies Adddressing headers MUST be present on incoming messages. |false
|`responses`    |If addressing is enabled, this property determines if endpoint requires
the use of anonymous responses, or non-anonymous responses, or all. |`Responses.ALL`
|==================================

The generated WSDL must indicate the use of addressing as specified in
the section <<j2w11svcports>>. The runtime requirements of enabling
addressing for SOAP binding are specified in section <<addressing>>.

[[mtomannotation]]
==== javax.xml.ws.soap.MTOM

The `MTOM` annotation is applied to an endpoint implementation class
and to an injected web service proxy reference.
It is used to control the use of MTOM. It corresponds to the
`MTOMFeature` described in section <<mtomfeature>>.

[id="Table 7.15"]
Table 7.15: `MTOM` properties.
|==================================
|Property   |Description    |Default
|`enabled`  |Specifies if MTOM is enabled or not.  |true
|`threshold` |Specifies the size in bytes that binary data SHOULD be before
being sent as an attachment. |0
|==================================

[[respbindingannotation]]
==== javax.xml.ws.RespectBinding

The `RespectBinding` annotation is applied to an endpoint implementation
class

and to an injected web service proxy reference

. It is used to control whether a JAX-WS implementation MUST
respect/honor the contents of the `wsdl:binding` associated with an
endpoint. It has a corresponding `RespectBindingFeature` described in
section <<respbindfeature>>.

[id="Table 7.16"]
Table 7.16: `RespectBinding` properties.
|==================================
|Property   |Description    |Default
|`enabled`  |Specifies whether the wsdl:binding must be
respected or not.  |true
